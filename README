Android log viewer is the tool to simplify analysis of the Android logs. It allows filtering
the logs using the number of filters.

Available filters:
	- by tag(s)
	- by PID(s)
	- entries containing specified text in message
	- by priority

Available actions on filtered lines:
	- show only matching lines
	- highlight matching lines
	- hide matching lines

The tool can parse adb output or a dumpstate file specified in the command line.

Tips:
	- right-click on a log entry shows popup menu that allows fast hiding messages with entry's PID or tag.

Android log viewer is the tool to simplify analysis of the Android logs. It allows filtering
the logs using the number of filters.

Available filters:
    - by tag(s)
    - by PID(s)
    - entries containing specified text in message
    - by priority
    - by log type (main, events, radio, etc)

Available actions on filtered lines:
    - show only matching lines
    - highlight matching lines
    - hide matching lines

The tool can parse adb output or a dumpstate file specified in the command line.
